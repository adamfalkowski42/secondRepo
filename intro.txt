This	 is where the intro goes


--go to your directory
 -- git init DemoApp -- initializes a git local repo in the DemoApp Location
 -- Use notepad++ to create different files that you want to store in your DemoApp
 -- git add "file name" to add your file to the git repo -- staged on the git repo
 -- git commit -m " message"
 
 --if you have a bunch of files in your location instead of typing out each file name
	-- Just do add . to add all the files

-- Using git hub
	--Through the git cmd 
		-- Navigate to the folder location
	-- Ask git if there is a remote already configured
		--git remote -v  -- if no response then nothing setup
		
	-- git remote add origin https://github.com/falkowa42/secondRepo.git -- this is my repo on github
	
	--git remote -v
		-- it will create two origins a fetch and a push
	git push -u origin master -- pushes local content to the v- reference
		-- then will have to login
		-- my login first failed then had to SSH in 
	-- after the User Name / PW goes through it loaded my files to github.
